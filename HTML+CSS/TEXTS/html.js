 * ! 1. HTML Basics
 * ----------------
 * 
 * * HTML
 * - Hyper Text Markup Language [tool which is used to create websites]
 * 
 * - every file has some instructions given to computer.. instructions later on execution from top - bottom and tells browser to construct a webpage
 *    - every HTML file should have ".html" extension
 * 
 * # HTML ELEMENT
 * - ELEMENT: a term that is used to describe anything to display on the webpage 
 * ex:
 *    <button>CLICK</button> "this is an HTML element"
 * 
 * # HTML TAG 
 * - the element we try to create will be placed inside angular brackets: "<>" [<TAG-NAME>]
 *    - every HTML element contains an opening and closing tag
 * 
 * ? BUTTON-TAG
 * ---
 *    <button>CLICK</button> 
 *      |       |         |
 * opening-tag  |       closing-tag
 *              content
 * >>> <tag-name>:  opening-tag only consists of plain angular brackets
 * >>> </tag-name>: but closing contains a slash in-front of tag-name
 *  
 * 1. button:     <button></button>           [used to create buttons inside a web-page]
 * 2. paragraph:  <p>"paragraph-content"</p>  [create paragraph with this!]
 * 3. anchor:     <a>LINK TO TARGET</a>       [used to create links which takes users to target]
 * 
 * $ NOTE
 * - but <a></a> anchor element is in-complete without an HTML attribute which is "href"
 * 
 * # HTML ATTRIBUTE
 * - this modifies how an element behaves 
 *    - we can have multiple attributes on same element but has to be separated with space!
 * 
 * >>> SINGLE ATTRIBUTE
 * <a href="/link/">CLICK HERE</a>
 *      |         \
 * att. name     att. value [what we are modifying it to (value: modifying to a link: "/link")]
 *      |
 * [what we are modifying (href: modifying the destination)] 
 * 
 * >>> MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES
 * <a href="/link/" target:"_blank">link-in-new-page</a>
 *        |               |
 *    attribute-1       attribute-2
 * 
 * ? ANCHOR ELEMENT
 * ---
 * >>> href:    changes the behavior of anchor tags >> instructs anchor tag where respective link goes!
 * >>> target:  modifies where does link opens >> NEW TAB or CURRENT TAB
 * 
 * $ NOTE
 * - 1. 'href' and 'target' works inside only anchor element 
 *    - there are respective attributes that are used to modify every tag
 * 
 * - 2. extra spaces are ignored inside HTML 
 *    - if any ? will be replaced with single space!
 * [whether those spaces between elements OR content]
 * 
 * - 3. new lines inside an element also counted as extra spaces 
 *    - hence ignored inside HTML!
